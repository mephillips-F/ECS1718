    However, the problem is that the copyright law states that no one can resell, copy, or reproduce it without the owner's permission. Also, it is stealing the owner's product. there are consequences that is worse if you try to illegally download it. You can go to jail for five years. Even worse, the copyright owner can file a lawsuit aginst you. Also, the device containing that pirate song file can not be immune to viruses, which of course, is not good.
